        <h1>What we do</h1>

        <h5>The landfall of Cyclone Nisarga over Raigad district on Wednesday left eight of the 15 talukas – Alibag, Murud, Pen, Tala, Srivardhan, Margaon, Mhasala and Roha – with no electricity or communication connectivity in many areas.</h5>
        <p>
            Cyclone Nisarga in coastal Maharashtra on June 3rd, left the Konkan region devasted. It was particularly severe on Bankot and the neighbouring villages perhaps upto a hundred km radius.
            It left devastating effects and probably it will have lasing effects for generations.
            The wind effect was so strong that barring few RCC constructed houses, roofs flew away for all, many houses were left with the walls damaged and a few don't exist anymore.
            Mangoes are the primary source of income. Majority of these mango trees have been uprooted and the ones that are left are severely damaged leaving many stress out and wondering if the restoration would take decades to witness normalcy.
            Mountains are completely shaved off the trees whether Mango, Cashew or a part of forest that maintained the pleasant weather.
            Power failure, humidity, water shortage and no supply and probably never witnessing the natural balance.
            More than 95% of houses got damaged. By the grace of god there is no death reported in the district. However it has brought unexpected sufferings to our society. Situation is heart wrenching.
            I humbly ask your support to provide some sort of relief to families who have lost their source of primary income. With your help we can save some families from this vulnerable situation.<br>
            We will help the needy people from your donations directly. we will help the needy from your donations directly.
            Thank you !!!!
